# Predicting-Purchase-Behaviour-on-E-Commerce-Data
This is the capstone project I did as part of the 6 months course on machine learning. 

A very classic problem faced by such e-commerce websites is understanding the purchase behaviour of a customer. If they can correctly predict which products the customers going to buy before the customer orders them, it can give them a huge advantage in terms of warehouse stocking, delivery times, marketing strategy, improving customer experience on their app etc.

The main goal of this project is to use the data of GroceryKart customer orders over time, to predict which previously purchased products will be in a userâ€™s next order. 

Here I have done EDA analysis, cleaning of the data, feature engineering, modelling and validation.
